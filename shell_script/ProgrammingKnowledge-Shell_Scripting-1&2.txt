Before writing a script, it is a good practice to write what kind of a script is being written.
For Example: If it is a Bash Script, always start with "#! /bin/bash"

echo : It is used to print a string or a variable.
Ex: echo "Hello! World"

Variables :
System Variables : Are created and maintained by UNIX OS. These defined in Capital Letters
Ex : PWD, HOME, BASH etc,
User Variables : are created and maintained by End User. These are defined in small letters
Ex : sum, difference, name etc


Script
-------
*************************************************
	#! /bin/bash

	echo "Hello! World"
	echo $BASH
	echo $BASH_VERSION
	echo $HOME
	echo $PWD

	name = Pradeep
	age = 31
	echo My Name is $name and my age is $age
